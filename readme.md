# MONEY HEIST - The weird race

A funny mini video game affords the player the opportunity to wager on characters as they race against one another. I constructed this game during my first semester at university, when I was just l "Hello, World" ðŸ˜‚.

## Usage

Run file `main.py` to start the game.
To log in, simply enter your `username` and `password` in the login window and the game will automatically register for you (What a naive game ðŸ˜‚).

<span style="color:red">Note</span> In this game, the player engages in interaction through the utilization of the <span style="color:green">keyboard</span> .

## Gameplay

- At the first start, player will participate in a minigame to earn money to join the main gameplay.
- There are five maps, each corresponding to a set of characters.
- Before joining the main gameplay, the player has the opportunity to purchase a randomly generated amulet with either a beneficial or detrimental effect. The player may activate the amulet during races by pressing `space`, and it will have an impact on the character that the player has selected.
- Indulge in a game of chance and select the sum you wish to stake. If fortune favors your chosen character and they cross the finish line in first place, your winnings shall be doubled. However, if fate has other plans, your wager shall be forfeited ðŸ˜‚.
